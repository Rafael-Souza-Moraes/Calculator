# Calculator

This was a project that I made without searching solutions on internet, just using programming logic and thinking a lot about changes and updates. It was tested a lot of times before I upload it here. I just searched two things: "How to truncate an integer on C#" and "How to make a MDIParent on C#" - just these. And, the most important thing I can say, is that I had the opportunity to test my own knowledge about C# structure, like: Methods, Variables, Logic, Converting values, Not letting the user making errors and, in general, Windows Forms App

I know there's a lot of things I can do to optimize the App, like using Classes and more advanced functions. But I don't know yet how to do this, and affirming that I won't search solutions on internet.

That's it! I hope this one can increase on my Portfolio.
